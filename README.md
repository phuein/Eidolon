# Eidolon

A Metaverse. An online living virtual world.

## Abstract

Vibrant and persuasive Non-Player Character civilizations are at the core of this world. It is a simulated universe filled with stars, each a solar system with its own planets and a variety of celestial bodies. In some of those, will be a planet giving life to fauna, flora, and intelligent beings. And those lucky enough to survive will create complex societies, where Eidolons, our spirits coming from Earth, intervene, influence, and dominate!
